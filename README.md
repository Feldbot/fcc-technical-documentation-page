# Build a Technical Documentation Page

The [Build a Technical Documentation Page](https://feldbot.github.io/fcc-technical-documentation-page//) project is part of Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design certificate curriculum. The [project requirements](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page/) are to create a responsive technical documentation page that has inline anchors for navigation, uses responsive media queries, and passes integrated tests.         

## Built With

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Responsive design framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

## Installing

* Download or clone the repository and open the `index.html` file to view locally. Dependencies are linked to from `index.html`.
* If using Sass in your project, use `app.scss` as the source file. Sass will compile this into `app.css`.

## Testing

Free Code Camp integrates testing to ensure projects pass requirements. Tests are embedded into the page and accessible from the menu at top left.
